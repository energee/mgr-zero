-- Keg-deposit eligibility in one place (#497). adjust_order_lines_impl
-- repeated ensure_order_deposit_lines' selection and its "returnable keg
-- deposit is not configured" check; it now keeps only its catalog locks and
-- charges lines without a deposit row through that function. A retained line
-- keeps the charge it was reviewed with; only its quantity follows the
-- adjustment. The check still raises before the function returns, so a bad
-- configuration rolls back every change the adjustment made.
